# DSAimager

The DSA imager project is a collection of gpu-accelerated code to image and localize fast radio bursts (FRBs) in realtime. As an example of the capabilities of this project, the following .gif shows an imaged pulse coming from the pulsar at the heart of the crab nebula:

The code produces an image of the radio sky every 1.04 milliseconds with a resolution of 25 arcseconds.
